<p>Monopolies, censorship, consumerism. Fears concerning technology companies, prominently Big Tech conglomerates with multibillion dollar marketshare, have been on the minds of common populace in the last decade. Megacorporations such as Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft have been put under the lens for seemingly monopolistic practices and unregulated growth as a symbiosis between the corporation and the people formed during the digital age. It goes without saying that in most modern developed countries where over 80% of the population owns a mobile phone and nearly 90% of the population has ready access to the internet, corporations which are able to dominate in these markets will undeniably have great amounts of power and influence bestowed unto them. The power to sway public opinion, the power to gradually strip us of our autonomy due to our dependencies on their technology, the power to decide for us.

In an increasingly interconnected world, the services provided by tech have played an integral role in our daily lives. This is especially so during the Covid-19 pandemic, where lockdowns in several part of the world have led many to turn to these services to keep themselves entertained. However, many critics have argued that too much power has been placed in the hands of tech companies, pointing specifically towards Big Tech companies such as Facebook, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Apple, or FAGMA, as they are known to the general public, and their alleged abuse of power to maintain their large</p>
