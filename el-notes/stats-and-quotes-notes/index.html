<p>An AI chatbot developed in South Korea named Luda Lee, initially popular for its cheerful disposition and ability to talk like a human being, quickly became the source of controversy after it made inappropriate comments regarding women&rsquo;s rights, lesbianism and disability, joining a long list of such chatbots infamous for their polarising opinions, often contrary to public opinion, including Microsoft&rsquo;s Tay, Japan&rsquo;s Rinna and China&rsquo;s BabyQ. The company behind it was also sued for disseminating personal information of the users.</p>

<p>Research done by the University of Montreal suggests that AI has better clinical decision-making capability than do humans, but generally in a more secondary sense, i.e. in the form of a second opinion.</p>

<p>A horrifying application of AI has been tools developed by many that utilise DeepFake technology in the form of false shaming individuals. For example, a site that has been recently taken down involved taking in the image of a face, and mapping that onto a Pornographic Film using DeepFake technology.

<p>AI algorithms developed by Big Tech and integrated into commerical and consumer products which drive the daily function of workplaces and people&rsquo;s lifestyles such as Google&rsquo;s search engine may gain more affordance than it should. Gebru Timnit, a researcher at Google&rsquo;s AI labs, grew wary of how quickly such technology were deployed and gaining dominance, and had criticise how black box language models developed by Google and competitors such as Microsoft&rsquo;s GPT-3, may for instance be trained on abusive language of the internet and develop biases yet elbow out promising alternatives, and later cause the future of AI technology to be built on shaky foundations&hellip; (List examples from other sections; e.g. coded gaze, stanford facial recognition; google&rsquo;s featured snippets).</p>

<p>Use of AI in courts: see Science and Technology/Tech/AI/AI in courts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: Advisory AI: Civil Resolution Tribunal (CRT) in British Columbia, Canada for disputes relating to subsidised housing. Predictive AI: Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions for predicting recidivism, has been known to overestimate recidivism among African American defendants compared to Caucasian Americans (though this may be natural consequence of greater concentrations of black felons in some areas), judges using the tool detain people more than before although it was intended to suade judges towards the opposite outcome.</li>
<li>This human control was an issue in the Loomis case, before the Supreme Court of Wisconsin.16 At stake were: (1) whether the use of the result of a risk assessment by an instrument such as COMPAS, where the operation is a business secret, violates the defendant’s right to a fair trial because the secret operation deprives a defendant of the opportunity to test the accuracy and scientific value of the risk assessment, and (2) whether it violates the right to a fair trial to rely on such a risk assessment because it includes gender and race in the assessment of the risk of recurrence. The Wisconsin Supreme Court dismissed Loomis’ objections, but said that the judge should give reasons as to how he or she uses COMPAS. The case was referred to the Supreme Court of the United States, which decided not to hear the case.</li>
<li>Pros: Reduced Recidivism, streamlines process and makes it more accessible (cheaper and faster), possibly reduce bias of human jurors (more for felonies since human jurors are supposed to be competent), cases like divorce and employment contract terminations are predictable and the job of a court proceeding is often merely to check all the terms are fulfilled.</li>
<li>Cons: In the US, predictive tools are offered commericially and workings are thus business secrets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ethical Principles (mostly pertaining to previous point): Outlined by The Commission for the Efficiency of Justice (CEPEJ) of the Council of Europe:</p>
<ol>
<li>Respect for fundamental rights. Ensure that design and implementation of AI services and tools are compatible with fundamental rights such as privacy, equal treatment and fair trial.</li>
<li>Equal treatment. Avoid discrimination between individuals and groups of individuals. The example of COMPAS above shows that discrimination and unjustified distinction between individuals and groups, is a real risk. The data used by the algorithm may be the cause, and the prejudice may also be embedded in the algorithm itself.</li>
<li>Data security. When processing judicial decisions and data, certified sources and data that cannot be altered should be used, with models that are multidisciplinary in design, in a secure technological environment.</li>
<li>Transparency. Data processing methods should be made transparent and comprehensible, and external audits should be allowed. The requirement of transparency is now established case law. The user of an algorithm must make public the choices made, and the data and assumptions used, in a complete, timely and appropriate manner so that these choices, data and assumptions are accessible to third parties. Such full, timely and appropriate disclosure should make it possible to assess the choices made and the data, reasoning and assumptions used, so as to ensure effective legal protection against decisions based on those choices, data, reasoning and assumptions, with the possibility of judicial review by the courts.</li>
<li>AI under user control. The algorithm may not be used as a prescription, i.e. the computer does not prescribe anything and cannot decide by itself. Users must know and understand what the AI does, and the users must be in control of the choices they make. This means that users must be able to deviate from the outcome of the algorithm without difficulty.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>What can happen when IT is blindly relied upon is shown by an example from the courts in the United Kingdom.18 There, a relatively simple piece of IT determines the financial capacity of (ex)-spouses in maintenance proceedings. The parties fill in a PDF form, and the IT calculates the resulting capacity. Due to a small mistake, which went unnoticed, incorrect calculations were made in 3,638 cases between April 2011 and January 2012, and between April 2014 and December 2015. Debts, instead of being deducted, had been added to the assets, so the assets taken into account were too high. In cases that were still pending, this could still be corrected. However, incorrect decisions were issued, and presumably complied with, in more than 2,200 cases.</p>

<li>Companies retroactively policing those who express dissent against China. Many such cases: John Cena calling Taiwan a country, LeBron James &amp; Morey in solidarity with HK, Mercedes Benz quoting Dalai Lama. While individually the cases are not major, the opinions were expressed on english platforms (some banned in China like Twitter), towards english-speaking audiences.</li>
<li>PNTR (Permanent Normal Trade Relations which promised US-Chinese economic integration) during Clinton administration was not only for economic growth, but also for the US to abet the liberaization of the human potential of the people with American values in society and trade. (socially and economically since China is communist and micromanages private industries unlike US). However, unexpectedly censorship was smuggled into the US as to be elaborated.</li>
<li>Apple TV streaming service disallows any content which criticises or paints China as a villain. While reasonable to market to Chinese consumers, a blanket categorical ban on any such content should ring alarm bells, especially when considering news agencies are pro-profit (slight stretch).</li>
<li>Big tech is ultimately pulling the strings of countries as diplomatic agents as for instance since the chinese depend on iCloud and other technologies and does not want to fall behind the west and America does not want to falter in its ambition of liberating Chinese or lose economic primacy. While US and China are playing a precarious game of Twister, Big Tech (In this case FAANG rather than BATX) is free to hold their services hostage and leverage what type of content they will distribute or sponsor, thus influencing mass media, which is a threat to democracy yada yada.</li>

<li>Ten of 24 US Governmental agencies surveyed plan to broaden their use of facial recognition systems by 2023, while eighteen of 24 currently use some form of the technology, according to an August 2021 report by the US Government Accountability Office (GAO).</li>
<li><a href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/study-finds-gender-skin-type-bias-artificial-intelligence-systems-0212">Facial recognition has proved to be less accurate on people with darker skin</a>, women, and younger and older people,  according to a 2018 paper presented by MIT and Stanford University researchers. This was due to the fact that dataset used to assess its performance was more than 77 percent male and more than 83 percent white. Leading to a disparity of nearly 46% for some individuals.</li>
<li><a href="https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/agre/bar-code.html">Your face is not a barcode - Arguments against Facial Recognition Technology (2003)</a> Comprehensive list of arguments against the use of facial recognition and rebuttals of common arguments.
<ul>
<li>Large potential by abuse by governments (e.g. China &amp; Uyghers) or becoming compromised by hackers</li>
<li>As opposed to other similar technologies like fingerprinting, facial recognition requires least cooperation from the individual as one can be identified in a crowd from afar. Thus it is quite open to attack vectors.</li>
<li>Quite fallible to false positives and inaccuracies from poor lighting conditions e.g.</li>
<li>Inefficient among all the false positives, i.e. 1 terrorist among 1000 false positives. Other measures may be preferable for such use-cases, despite scares pushing towards facial recognition post-9/11.</li>
<li>Hard to give effective notice, and gain proper consent. Adoption in public spaces such as government buildings or other institutions means it is a fait accompli that those uncomfortable with the technology have to accept.</li>
<li>Technology may not necessarily be only accessible and implemented by the government but also by businesses or district authorities, who may wittingly or unwittingly abuse the technology</li>
<li>Sets a poor precedents as even if it is well-implemented by wealthier and democratic governments with respect for civil liberties, it may gain adoption among less enlightened governments. For instance, a report by The Conservation where some Chinese citizens were informally interviewed on their thoughts on the government&rsquo;s inexorable push for social surveillance systems believed the west also had similar concepts of social credit which China is justified to follow to catch up with other superpowers. They welcome the infringements of the civil liberties in favor of the public order solidified by such developments (May not necessarily be deluded, just differing culture). If the west must adopt facial recognition to protect the nation or safeguard their democracy, then the artificial &lsquo;Tian&rsquo; watching over Chinese citizens or similar facsimilies that may prop up in other nations will only gain in prevalance and apparent signficance in protecting a nation&rsquo;s civil morals.</li>
