      <description>Theranos Theranos has been a very clear indicator of how much trust we have in technology today. The scandal was one of the many such cases involving market fraud and the misleading of shareholders over the past few years and has been helmed as Silicon Valley’s Greatest Disaster. With an idea as incredible as was the founder’s, Elizabeth Holmes, who possessed a very limited amount of knowledge regarding medical trials and entrepreneurial methods and a small patent developed within a few five days, Theranos seemed doomed from the start, yet it grew from a simple start-up in 2003 to a highly valued company with a valuation of about 9 billion dollars in 2014.</description>
